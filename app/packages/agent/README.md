# 10thfloor:agent

A Pi-based agent harness for Meteor 3.5+. The transcript is a Mongo collection,
streaming tokens are a capped collection, and tools are Meteor methods.

## Install

```bash
meteor add 10thfloor:agent
meteor npm install --save @earendil-works/pi-ai
```

## Define an agent

```ts
// imports/agents.ts — isomorphic
import { Agent } from 'meteor/10thfloor:agent';
export const Support = new Agent('support');

// server/agents.ts — server only
import { Support } from '/imports/agents';
Support.define({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-5',
  instructions: ({ userId }) => `You help user ${userId}.`,
  tools: ['orders.lookup'],
  provider: myProvider,   // required in Milestone 1 — see below
});
```

## Use it from the client

```ts
const sessionId = await Support.start();
Support.subscribe(sessionId);
await Support.send(sessionId, 'where is my order?');

Support.messages(sessionId).fetch();   // reactive, includes in-flight tokens
Support.status(sessionId);             // 'idle' | 'streaming' | 'calling' | …
```

One `Agent` instance renders one session at a time: `subscribe()` repoints the
merged view at the session you pass it and evicts the previous one. Construct a
second `Agent` to watch two sessions side by side.

## Testing without an API key

```ts
import { mockProvider } from 'meteor/10thfloor:agent';
Support.define({ model: 'mock', instructions: '…', provider: mockProvider(() => ({ text: 'hi' })) });
```

## Anonymous sessions

Sessions started without a login carry `userId: null` and behave as
capability-URLs: anyone who knows the session id has full access, and no one
can enumerate ids in bulk (`agent.sessions` publishes nothing to anonymous
callers). Two consequences to design for: an anonymous session **stays**
anonymous after the user logs in — it is not adopted by the account, and
remains reachable by anyone holding the id — and inline tools receive
model-supplied arguments unvalidated (adopted Meteor methods keep their own
`check()` calls; validate inline tool args yourself until TypeBox validation
lands in Milestone 2).

## Milestone 1 scope

`provider` is required — the pi-ai adapter that would default it is Milestone 2.
Also deferred: approval gates, budgets and cost accounting, compaction, provider
retry/backoff, an automatic orphan-claim watcher (a turn abandoned by a server
restart is recovered on the next `send`, not automatically), and
`DDPRateLimiter` rules on `agent.send`.

See `docs/superpowers/specs/` for the full design.
